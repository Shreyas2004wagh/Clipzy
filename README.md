# 🎬 Clippa – YouTube Video Clipper SaaS

**Clippa** (or Clipzy) is a lightweight SaaS tool that allows users to clip and download specific segments of any YouTube video by simply providing the URL and desired timestamps. It trims the video on the backend using `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`, and instantly delivers downloadable clips — no cloud storage required.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ Precise timestamp-based clipping  
- 🎥 Supports most YouTube formats via `yt-dlp`  
- ⚡ Fast, on-demand backend trimming using `ffmpeg`  
- 🧾 Subtitles and format selection support (optional)  
- 🧼 Clean UI built with `shadcn/ui` and TailwindCSS  
- 🔐 No login, no storage — just paste and clip

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React + TypeScript  
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

**Backend**
- Express (running on Bun)
